Tiles

This is an AddOn for MODX Revolution.  "Tiles" are small tiles of data including an image
that you can create via a Custom Manager Page (See Components --> Tiles).  Tiles can be 
created manually or by dragging and dropping images into the dropzone on the grid page.
Images can also be cropped. You can drag and drop them into any order. Think of your Tiles
like a deck of cards which you arrange in front of you.  

Tiles are best suited for a smallish number of items (approximately 100 or less). 
There is no pagination (yet), so the interface becomes untenable if you attempt to manage
too many items.
